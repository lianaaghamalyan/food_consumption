# Food Consumption Analysis
- **Data Source:** Provided Excel dataset containing food consumption and CO2 emissions per food category across various countries.
- **Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel for data analysis and visualization.
- **Outputs:**  
  - Excel file containing pivot tables, bar charts, and scatter plots.
  - **PowerPoint Presentation** summarizing key insights and highlighting visualizations.

## Visualizations & Analysis
The Excel file contains multiple sheets with pivot tables and charts:
- **Country-wise Consumption & Emissions** – Total consumption and CO2 emissions by country.
- **Food Category Breakdown** – Aggregated consumption and emissions by food categories.
- **Consumption vs. Emissions Comparison** – Visual comparison between food consumption and emissions.
- **Group Analysis (Meat, Plant, Byproducts)** – Grouping food categories into meat-based, plant-based, and byproducts for a clearer impact comparison.
- **Scatter Plot Analysis** – Relationship between food consumption and CO2 emissions.

### Presentation (PPT)
To **better present the visualizations and key statements**, a **PowerPoint Presentation** was created.  
The PPT visually summarizes the analysis and highlights the main findings in a clearer, more accessible format compared to raw Excel sheets.
